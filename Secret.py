Here is a complex and heavily documented "Hello World" script written in INTERCAL, a very obscure and esoteric programming language:


DO WRITE IN .1, PLEASE DO NEXT
PLEASE WRITE IN .1 <- !97¢.
PLEASE READ OUT .1
  
DO .1000 <- #1 DO .1001 <- #1
PLEASE READ OUT #.1
DO POINT .1 <- 564
DO .1080 <- .1 NEXT
DO FORGET #.1
PLEASE NOTE THAT "-a" MEANS "give up on sanity"
PLEASE REMEMBER TO FOLLOW CONVENTIONS AND READ THE FINE PRINT
PLEASE GIVE UP

DO .1 <- #80
DO ,1 ← #72 DO ,2 ← #101 DO ,3 ← #108 DO ,4 ← #108 DO ,5 ← #111
DO ,6 ← #44 DO ,7 ← #32 DO ,8 ← #87 DO ,9 ← #111
DO,10 ← #114 DO,11 ← #108 DO,12 ← #100 DO,13 ← #33
DO,14 <- #10

DO FORGET .1 DO FORGET .1000 DO (.,1) NEXT
DO (.,2) NEXT DO (.,3) NEXT DO (.,4) NEXT
DO (.,5) NEXT DO (.,6) NEXT DO (.,7) NEXT
DO (.,8) NEXT DO (.,9) NEXT DO(.,10) NEXT 
DO(.,11) NEXT DO(.,12) NEXT DO(.,13) NEXT
DO(.,14) NEXT DO RESUME .1
