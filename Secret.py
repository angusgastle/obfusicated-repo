This is a Brainfuck program, which is known for its minimalistic and esoteric style. Here's a breakdown of the Brainfuck commands used:

- `+` increment the byte at the data pointer.
- `-` decrement the byte at the data pointer.
- `>` increment the data pointer (to point to the next cell to the right).
- `<` decrement the data pointer (to point to the next cell to the left).
- `[` if the byte at the data pointer is zero, then jump forward to the command after the matching `]`.
- `]` if the byte at the data pointer is nonzero, then jump back to the command after the matching `[`.
- `.` output the byte at the data pointer as a character.

The program initializes cells with appropriate ASCII values and then outputs them as characters to form the message "Hello World".
