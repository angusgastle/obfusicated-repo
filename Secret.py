The above script is written in Whitespace, a language consisting entirely of spaces, tabs, and linefeeds. This program performs the simple task of printing "Hello World" with each character pushed to the stack and then printed in order. Each stack manipulation and print instruction is heavily annotated to explain the steps involved in the simplest program.
