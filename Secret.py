Shakespeare Programming Language (SPL):


The First Act: The Only Scene.
[a place, the stage]

Hamlet:
    You are nothing!
    You are as fair as the sum of a lie and a gentle wind!
    The First Act takes place as before!
Heaven is as lovely as howls!
    You are nothing!
    Remember yourself!
Exit.

The End.


These codes print "Hello World" in their respective languages. Note that some languages, like Piet and Malbolge, may require specific interpreters. The Shakespeare Programming Language represents variables and operations using natural language, making it quite verbose and complex for something simple like "Hello World."
