# Befunge-93 Script to display "Hello World"

# Befunge-93 is an esoteric programming language in which the behavior of the program is 
# encoded in a two-dimensional grid. The instructions are represented as single characters, 
# and a program counter moves around the grid to execute them.

# Direction pointers (>, <, ^, v) dictate the flow within this grid, and string mode is 
# initiated with a double quote (").

# Let's write "Hello, World!" in the Befunge-93 language in a complex manner:

>25*"!dlroW ,olleH":v
                 v:,_@    
                 > ^       

# Breaking down the code:
# - '>' points to the right and moves the instruction pointer (IP) to the next cell.
# - '2' pushes the digit 2 onto the stack.
# - '5' pushes the digit 5 onto the stack.
# - '*' pops the top two stack values, multiplies them (5*2=10), and pushes the result (10) onto the stack.
# - '!' pops the top stack value and pushes "1" if it's zero, otherwise "0" (this will be used later, doesn't change stack here).
# - '"' enters string mode.
# - 'dlroW ,olleH' pushes each character of "Hello, World!" onto the stack (in reverse order due to the stack-based nature).
# - '"' exits string mode.
# - ':' duplicates the top stack value. When it first hits the first 'H', it duplicates 'H'.
# - 'v' redirects the IP downwards.
# - When the IP lands at the lower 'v', it continues downwards to ':'.
# - ':' duplicates the top stack value.
# - ',' pops the top of the stack and outputs it as a character (this prints the characters one by one).
# - '_' pops the top stack value and moves the IP right if the value is zero, left otherwise.
# - '@' terminates the program.

# As a result, you loop vertically printing the stack characters one by one from right to left until the stack is empty,
# thus printing "Hello, World!" in a rather complex manner.
