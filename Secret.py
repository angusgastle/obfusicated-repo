This Whitespace programming code spells the classic "Hello World" sentence. Whitespace is an esoteric programming language that uses only spaces, tabs, and linefeeds to instruct the computerâ€”making it invisible to anyone viewing the source code who expects to see typical programming syntax.

- Spaces encode some instructions.
- Tabs are used in other specific functionalities, particularly for operating with different types of commands.
- Linefeeds are usually used to separate commands.
