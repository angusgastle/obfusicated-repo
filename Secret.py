L


In this code:
- `S` (space) represents pushing a number onto the stack.
- `T` (tab) is used to denote operations.
- `L` is a line feed used to separate commands. 

This program pushes the ASCII values of the characters for "Hello, World!" onto the stack and then prints them out. It's lengthy and complex due to the repetition and simplicity of the commands available in the Whitespace language.
