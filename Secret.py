This is a "Hello World" script written in Brainfuck, an esoteric programming language created by Urban MÃ¼ller in 1993. Each command in Brainfuck consists of one character and operates on an array of memory cells, each initially set to zero. Here's what each part of the code is doing:

- `++++++++++` increments the first cell to 10. This is often used as a counter for loops.

- `[` begins a loop that will continue as long as the value at the current memory cell is nonzero.

- `>+++++++` moves to the next cell and adds 7 to it.
- `>++++++++++` moves to the next cell and adds 10 to it.
- `>+++` moves to the next cell and adds 3 to it.
- `>+` moves to the next cell and adds 1 to it.
- `<<<<-` moves back four cells (to the first cell) and decrements it by 1.

- `]` ends the loop. When the first cell reaches 0, Brainfuck exits the loop.

- `>++.` moves to the second cell and adds 2 (which results in 72, the ASCII value for 'H'), then outputs it (H).
- `>.+.` moves to the next cell and adds 1 to it (101, ASCII for 'e'), then outputs it (e).
- `+++++++..+++.` continues to alter and output the next characters ('l', 'l', 'o').
- `>++.` then outputs a space character.
- `<<+++++++++++++++.>.` moves back and sets up for the next characters, eventually printing 'W'.
- `+++.------.--------.` prints 'o', 'r', 'l', 'd'.
- `>+.>.` prints a space, then moves and prints the final character '!'. 

This code exemplifies how Brainfuck operates directly at memory cell manipulation level to output characters to the console.
