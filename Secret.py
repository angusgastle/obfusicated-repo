This snippet of code is an example of Whitespace programming. Whitespace is an esoteric language that uses only whitespace characters such as space, tab, and newline. The code is complex as it constructs the phrase "Hello World" through a series of stack manipulations and character outputs. Each character's ASCII value is pushed onto the stack and then printed. This code consists of push (S), duplicate top stack item (T), output as character (L), and end of the program (N) operations.

In Whitespace, non-whitespace characters are considered comments, making the code hard to read and obscure as intended. The tabs and spaces before non-whitespace characters (like 'T', 'L', and 'N') are the actual commands, while other characters serve merely as visual aid here for understanding the structure.
