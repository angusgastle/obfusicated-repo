Here is an example of displaying "Hello World" in the esoteric programming language Malbolge, which is known for its complexity and challenging nature. Malbolge was specifically designed to be almost impossible to use, with self-modifying code and encrypted instructions.

This specific code snippet will output "Hello World" when executed in a Malbolge interpreter. Each character is specifically chosen based on the encryption and crazy operating mechanisms of Malbolge.
