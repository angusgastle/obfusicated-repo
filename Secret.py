// This is an implementation of a "Hello World" program in the esoteric programming language Malbolge
// Malbolge is notoriously difficult for programming due to its complex rules and operation modes.
// It was created by Ben Olmstead in 1998 and was designed to be almost impossible to use.
// This program simply outputs "Hello World", but understanding how it works is not straightforward.

// The first line is actually the entire "Hello World" program.
// Malbolge is one of the few languages where a program looks like total gibberish, even to experienced coders.
// It uses a ternary (base-3) machine, which can be very confusing without a deep understanding of its mechanics.

// The program utilizes Malbolge's confusing encryption and self-modifying code features.
// In Malbolge, each command is self-modified after execution which makes the prediction of program flow extremely difficult.

// Malbolge programs are often generated by tools rather than written directly by humans, owing to their complexity.
// Each character in the Malbolge program is significant and alters the program state in some way.
