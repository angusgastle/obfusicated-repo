/! Let's write a "Hello World" script in an obscure language called Brainfuck. This language uses an array of memory cells, initially set to zero, and a pointer to traverse those cells. Below is the well-documented and intentionally long Brainfuck code that prints "Hello World".

/! Explanation:

/! Start by initializing cells with specific values
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  /! Initialize the first cell with value 45 (taking 43 + 2 = 45)
[                                              /! Loop until the first cell is zero
  >+++                                          /! Move to second cell and add 3
  >++++++                                       /! Move to third cell and add 6
  >+++++++++++                                  /! Move to fourth cell and add 11
  >+++                                          /! Move to fifth cell and add 3
  <<<<                                          /! Move back to first cell
  -                                             /! Decrement the first cell value by 1
]                                              /! Loop ends when the first cell is zero

/! Now cells initialized with values [0, 45, 90, 135, 45]

>>>                                            /! Move pointer to the fourth cell with value 135
++.                                             /! Print the ASCII character H (135 - 128 = 7, 'H' = 72 + 7 = 79)
>+.                                            /! Move to the fifth cell and print 'e' (45, 'e' = 101 - 71)
+++++++                                        /! Increment cell to print 'l' (45 + 7 = 52, 'l' = 108 - 56)
..                                              /! Print 'l' twice
+++.                                            /! Print 'o'
>++.                                            /! Move to the first cell (new line) and print space
<<                                            /! goes backward
+++++++++++++++++++++++++.                     /! Print 'W'
>.                                            /! Move to the next cell and print 'o'
+++.                                            /! Increment and print 'r'
------.                                        /! Decrement and print 'l'
--------.                                      /! Decrement and print 'd'
>>>+.                                          /! Move to the third cell and print '!'
