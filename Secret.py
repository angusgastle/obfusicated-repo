This Brainfuck code snippet does the following:
- Increments the value at the current cell to 10 (using `++++++++++`). This value is later used as a loop counter.
- The `[` starts a loop which will repeat 10 times.
- Inside the loop:
  - `>+++++++` moves the cell pointer to the right and adds 7 to this cell.
  - `>++++++++++` moves the pointer again and adds 10 to the next cell.
  - `>+++` and then `>+` increment the next two cells by 3 and 1 respectively.
  - `<<<<-` moves the pointer back 4 cells and decrements the current cell by 1 (acting as the loop counter).
- `>` moves the cell pointer right to the cell that now contains 70 (`H` in ASCII).
- `.` outputs the character 'H' (70 in ASCII).
- `>+.>` increments the next cell to 101, moves the pointer to the right, and prints 'e' (101 in ASCII).
- `+++++++..+++.` forms and outputs "llo".
- `>++.` moves to the cell with 32 (space), increments it, and outputs the space.
- `<<+++++++++++++++.>.+++.` moves back and adjusts cells to print "World".
- `------.--------.` adjusts ASCII values to print "!".
- `>+.>.` moves and adjusts cells to output newline or other characters to finalize the "Hello World!" message.
