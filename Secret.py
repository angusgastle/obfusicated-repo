This is a program written in Whitespace, a language made up entirely of spaces, tabs, and newlines (` `, `\t`, `\n`). Each type of whitespace character represents a different instruction or command, and their sequence dictates operations like stack manipulation, arithmetic, heap access, flow control, and I/O.

- Stack Manipulation: Space followed by space is the command used for pushing values onto the stack.
- Output: Tab followed by line feed is used for outputting the character at the top of the stack.

This script essentially pushes each character code of "Hello World" to the stack and then outputs it to display "Hello World".
