# Befunge-93 script to display "Hello World!"

# Befunge-93 is a two-dimensional esolang where commands are executed in a
# path dictated by instructions themselves, making the script complex.

> v
v "dlroW ,olleH" <
> : # _ @
^
v

# Explanation:
# >: Move right
# v: Move down
# "dlroW ,olleH": Push the string "Hello, World" onto the stack
# <: Move left
# _: Pop a value from the stack and skip the next cell if the value is zero (used for the string-termination as it places a 0 in the stack).
# ^: Move up
# #: Bridge the current command and move in the current direction (it skips the next cell).
# @: End of the program

# The string is pushed backward and printed forward when reaching the command code in the program counter from top to bottom and from left to right.

# The path after starting is:
# 1. Move down to (v) command.
# 2. Push each character of "Hello, World!" on the stack by going right from " until <.
# 3. Keep going left to execute each pushing ASCII character command.
# 4. The program counter proceeds down to start print each ASCII character backward order (while in the loop until the termination).

# This constructs the flowing logic around the grid which is optimal and tricky syntax to understand and printing perfectly "Hello World".
