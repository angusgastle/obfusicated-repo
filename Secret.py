// Whitespace program to print "Hello World"
// Whitespace is an esoteric programming language that uses spaces, tabs, and newlines as its commands.
// Commenting within Whitespace is not possible; instead, comments can only be done outside the actual code.

// The stack manipulation commands are used to push the ASCII values of the characters onto the stack.
// A stack-based language that considers only spaces, tabs and line feeds.

// Each command in Whitespace is represented by a series of spaces (representing 'push'), tabs, and linefeeds:
// Space (U+0020) - instruction modification
// Tab (U+0009) - stack manipulation, arithmetic, heap access, input/output
// LF (U+000A) - flow control

// The above Whitespace commands form a program that prints 'Hello World'.
