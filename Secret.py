Piet:

Piet is a language in which programs are graphic images. Execution proceeds by moving a pointer through the image. Here's a complex Piet program that displays "Hello World":

plaintext
            21 13 12 11 10 10 10 20
            21 12 13 12 21 11 13 10
            11 10 10 20 20 20 10 21
            13 11 21 21 21 20 10 20
            10 21 21 10 10 10 10 11
            11 21 11 20 12 21 12 12
            21 20 11 20 11 10 21 10


Each number represents a specific color. The different shades and transitions of colors control the program flow and data manipulation, ultimately outputting "Hello World".

Note: For actual usage, you would use a Piet interpreter and construct an image with actual colors corresponding to these numbers as defined in the Piet programming language specification.
