# Language: Whitespace

# Whitespace uses only spaces, tabs, and newlines to convey instructions.
# Comments (not part of code) are included purely for context and are not executed.

# Push character codes to stack and output each character individually.
# Use spaces, tabs (\t), and newlines (\n) only.

# Comments are outside the code for clarity

# Stack Manipulations:
# The following instructions push the ASCII values of 'Hello World\n' to the stack in reverse order
