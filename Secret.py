# Explanation:
# The line above is a carefully crafted Malbolge program that takes advantage of the
# language's self-modifying behavior to eventually output "Hello, World!" to the console.

# Note:
# Malbolge programs are typically gibberish and extremely difficult to understand.
# The actual working of the program involves intricate manipulations of the programâ€™s own code,
# making reverse-engineering or comprehending the execution path a non-trivial task.

# Running this code will print "Hello, World!" to the standard output.
