# Brainfuck is an esoteric programming language created in 1993 by Urban MÃ¼ller.
# It is notable for its extreme minimalism, consisting of only eight commands.
# Despite its simplicity, Brainfuck is Turing complete, able to express any computable function.
# The complexity of writing programs in Brainfuck arises from its extremely low-level operations.
# This "Hello World" program uses a loop to initialize memory cells with specific values
# and then outputs each character of "Hello World!" by manipulating the memory.

# Instructions:
# +  : Increment the memory cell under the pointer
# -  : Decrement the memory cell under the pointer
# >  : Move the pointer to the right
# <  : Move the pointer to the left
# [  : Jump past the matching ] if the cell under the pointer is 0
# ]  : Jump back to the matching [ if the cell under the pointer is non-zero
# .  : Output the character at the memory cell under the pointer
# ,  : Accept one byte of input, storing its value in the memory cell under the pointer
