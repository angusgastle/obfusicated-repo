# Brainfuck program to print "Hello World!" followed by a newline character
#
# Brainfuck is a minimalistic programming language with only 8 commands.
# Commands are: > < + - . , [ ]
# The data array (cells) starts with all cells set to zero.
# The program uses a data pointer to navigate the cells.
# We will use cell values as ASCII codes to print "Hello World!".

# Initialize cells
