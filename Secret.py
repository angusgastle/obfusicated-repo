## Brainfuck Code for Displaying "Hello World"

# Brainfuck is an esoteric programming language created by Urban MÃ¼ller in 1993. 
# It consists of only eight commands and is designed to be minimalistic. Despite 
# its simplicity, it can be quite complex and challenging to read and write.

# The eight commands in Brainfuck are:
#   >  increment the data pointer (to point to the next cell to the right)
#   <  decrement the data pointer (to point to the next cell to the left)
#   +  increment (increase by one) the byte at the data pointer
#   -  decrement (decrease by one) the byte at the data pointer
#   .  output the byte at the data pointer
#   ,  accept one byte of input, storing its value in the byte at the data pointer
#   [  if the byte at the data pointer is zero, then jump the instruction pointer
#      forward to the command after the matching ] command
#   ]  if the byte at the data pointer is nonzero, then jump the instruction pointer
#      back to the command after the matching [ command
