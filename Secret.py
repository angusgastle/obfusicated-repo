Below is a script in INTERCAL for displaying "Hello World", a language designed to be as different and difficult as possible. INTERCAL is known for its deliberately obscure syntax and operations.

intercal
DO ,1 <- #13
PLEASE DO ,1 SUB #1 <- #238
DO ,1 SUB #2 <- #108
DO ,1 SUB #3 <- #112
DO ,1 SUB #4 <- #0
DO ,1 SUB #5 <- #64

DO ,1 SUB #11 <- #24
DO ,1 SUB #12 <- #16
DO ,1 SUB #13 <- #162

PLEASE READ OUT ,1
GIVE UP


In this script:
- `DO` and `PLEASE` are used to make the compiler more likely to compile the program without errors.
- The numbers assigned to each subscript of array ,1 are ASCII values manipulated to avoid common clear text.
- `READ OUT ,1` is used to output the modified content in ,1.
- `GIVE UP` is the standard way to end an INTERCAL program.
