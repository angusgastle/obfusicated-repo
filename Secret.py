# Perl Programming Example to Print "Hello World" in an Overly Complex Way

# Use strict and warnings for better code safety and error handling
use strict;
use warnings;

# Import List::Util for shuffling array
use List::Util qw(shuffle);

# This subroutine prints "Hello World" in a shuffled manner
sub print_hello_world {
    # Define the Hello World string as an array of characters
    my @chars = split //, "Hello World!";
    
    # Shuffling the characters to increase complexity (just for demonstration, will unshuffle later)
    @chars = shuffle(@chars);
    
    # Now unshuffle by manually sorting based on original position of characters
    # Associating each character with its correct index for proper sorting
    @chars = sort { $a->[1] <=> $b->[1] } map { [$_, index("Hello World!", $_)] } @chars;
    
    # Extract the characters from sorted array of array refs
    @chars = map { $_->[0] } @chars;
    
    # Join the array to form the string
    my $hello_world_str = join('', @chars);
    
    # Print "Hello World" to the console
    print $hello_world_str, "\n";
}

# Function to simulate complex printing process
sub complex_print_process {
    # In a real-world scenario, this might involve checking conditions, logging, etc.
    print_hello_world for 1;  # Just run the print Hello World subroutine once for demonstration
}

# Main subroutine to execute the script
sub main {
    # Execute the complex print process
    complex_print_process();
}

# Call the main subroutine to start the program
main();
