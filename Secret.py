This Whitespace program will output "Hello World" when run. Whitespace is an esoteric programming language that uses only whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, and newlines).

- The program consists of multiple lines, and the specific instructions are encoded in the presence or absence of these whitespace characters.
- This makes the code non-visible and difficult to read unless presented in an editor that can highlight these characters.
