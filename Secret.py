serpent
# Serpent is a programming language that was used for Ethereum smart contracts.
# It is now deprecated in favor of Solidity, but still interesting as an obscurity.
# This script will display "Hello World".

# Define the constant for 'Hello'
data 0x00 0x48656c6c6f # ASCII representation of "Hello" in hexadecimal

# Define the constant for 'World'
data 0x01 0x576f726c6421 # ASCII representation of "World!" in hexadecimal

# Main function
def main():
    # Load 'Hello' from storage
    hello <- mload(0x00)
    
    # Load 'World!' from storage
    world <- mload(0x01)
    
    # Create a buffer with 'Hello World!'
    buffer = concat(hello, world)
    
    # Display the result to the console
    log(message=buffer)
    
    return(buffer)

# Concatenate two strings
def concat(a: str, b: str) -> str:
    # Create an empty result string
    result = ""

    # Append first string
    for char in a:
        result += char

    # Append second string
    for char in b:
        result += char

    return result

# Custom logging utility
def log(message: str):
    # Emit the log to the console
