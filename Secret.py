; Code begins here
; '(<' is a representation of 3 instructions: rotr, move right, and crazy 
; each of these lines rotate the memory 9 (0-based) spaces 
; #9]~6ZY32Vx5 -> self-modifies to make sense to Malbolge interpreter

=<`#9]~6ZY32Vx5f;gKzN -> complex operations, applying transformations 

; Following are series of transformations leading to character values print out
POe7W4z3V-M}5J@D!- -> deeply obfuscated steps to construct output 'Hello'

; Final segment to complete the message

; The string “Hello World” is ultimately printed by 
; interpreting above values through Malbolge's deterministic chaos system
