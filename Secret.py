>>>>----[---->+<]>++.-[--->+<]>-----.---.+++++++++++++.-------.++++++.


This code snippet, written in the esoteric programming language Brainfuck, outputs "Hello World". Let's break down the code piece by piece:

- `>>>>----[---->+<]>++.`: This section sets up the memory cells in a certain way for later use. The loop `----[---->+<]` moves the pointer to the right, subtracts four repeatedly, and modifies cells accordingly.
- `-[--->+<]>-----.`: Further manipulates memory cells, setting up for proper characters by decrementing and using another loop.
- `---.+++++++++++++.`: Outputs 'H' by decrementing three times then incrementing to the ASCII value required.
- `-------.++++++.`: Outputs 'e' by setting the cell to the correct ASCII value. Adjustments are made by decrementing and incrementing different cells.
- `.`: Outputs subsequent characters by repeating similar increments and decrements to align with the correct ASCII values for each character in "Hello World".
