# Brainfuck is an esoteric programming language created in 1993 by Urban MÃ¼ller. It is designed to challenge and amuse programmers, 
# and it achieves this by providing a minimalistic set of commands and a very small compiler. Despite its simplicity, it's Turing complete.
#
# Brainfuck programs consist of a series of operations that manipulate an array of memory cells (initially all zero), along with a data pointer,
# initially pointing at the first memory cell. The commands of Brainfuck are:
#
# >    Move the data pointer to the right
# <    Move the data pointer to the left
# +    Increment the byte at the data pointer
# -    Decrement the byte at the data pointer
# .    Output the byte at the data pointer (as an ASCII character)
# ,    Accept one byte of input, storing its value in the byte at the data pointer
# [    If the byte at the data pointer is zero, then instead of moving the instruction pointer forward to the next command, 
#      jump it forward to the command after the matching ] command.
# ]    If the byte at the data pointer is nonzero, then instead of moving the instruction pointer forward to the next command, 
#      jump it back to the command after the matching [ command.
#
# The memory cells are like buckets that can hold integer values, and the data pointer is like a hand that can move left and right to
# different buckets. By incrementing and decrementing the values in these buckets, adding loops, and utilizing the ASCII values of 
# characters, Brainfuck can generate output like "Hello World".
#
# Below is an in-depth analysis of the provided Brainfuck code for "Hello World":

# This loop will add 10*7 ('+' 10 times, looped) to the first cell, then it will increment the subsequent cells to 70, 100, 30, and 10 respectively, 
# by moving the pointer and incrementing the values before looping back.
#
# >+++
# Move to the second cell and add 3, making it 103
#
# . 
# Output the value 72 ('H')
#
# >+ 
# Move to the third cell and add 1, making it 101
#
# . 
# Output the value 101 ('e')
#
# +++++++ 
# Add 7 to current cell, making it 108
#

# Output the value 108 ('l')
#

# Output 108 ('l') again

# Add 3 to current cell, making it 111
#

# Output the value 111 ('o')

# >++ 
# Move to the next cell, add 2, making it 32
#
# .
# Output the value 32 (Space)

# Move back to the 'H' cell and increment it by 16
#

# Output the value 87 ('W')

# Move to the next cell

# Output the value 111 ('o')

# Add 3, making it 114

# Output the value 114 ('r')

# Subtract 6, making it 108

# Output the value 108 ('l')

# -------- 
# Subtract 8, making it 100
#
# . 
# Output the value 100 ('d')
#
# >>>
# Move 3 cells to the right
#
# +
# Add 1, making it 1 (ASCII SOH)
#
# .
# Output this value
#
# >
# Move to the next cell
#
# ++++++++++
# Increment this cell by 10, making it 10
# 
# .
# Output this value (newline)
