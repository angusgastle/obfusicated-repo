[
    "++++++": Increment the current cell value by 6.
    "[>+++++++<-]>": Loop that moves the pointer to the next cell and increments it by 7, then goes back and decrements the initial cell by 1 until the initial cell is 0.
    ".": Print the ASCII character of the current cell value.
    "<++++++[>--------<-]>": Move back and increment the previous cell by 6, loop to move to the next cell and decrement by 8.
    ".": Print the next character.
    "<+++++[>++++++<-]>": Move back and increment by 5, loop to move to the next cell and increment it by 6.
    ".": Print the next character.
    "-[--->+<]>---": Move current cell and its neighbors by shifting all values to the right and decrementing the first 3 cells.
    ".": Print the next character.
    "-[--->++<]>-": Similar shifting but with additional increments of 2 and final decrements.
    ".": Print the next character.
    "+++++++++++.": Add 10 to the current cell and print the ASCII character.
    "-----.": Subtract 5 and print the next character.
    "--------.": Subtract 8 and print the next character.
    "--[--->+++<]>--.": Move and alter cell values by shifting 3 positions and incrementing by 3, then print the character.
    "-[--->++++<]>+.": Similar shifting but with additional increments of 4 and final increments.
    "----------.-------.": Subsequent decrementations by 10 and 7 then print characters.
