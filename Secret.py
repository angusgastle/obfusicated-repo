; Define a function named `display-hello-world`
; This function does not take any arguments and when invoked, 
; it will determine a complex and unpredictable method to display "Hello World".
(define (display-hello-world)
  ; Create a list of characters representing "Hello World"
  (define hello-world-list (string->list "Hello World"))
  
  ; Define a helper function to manipulate each character
  ; This will be used to obfuscate and then deobfuscate the characters
  (define (transform-character c shift)
    ; Convert character to ASCII, shift it by `shift` positions, convert back to character
    (integer->char (+ (char->integer c) shift)))

  ; Obfuscate characters by shifting each by 5 positions
  (define obfuscated-list (map (lambda (c) (transform-character c 5)) hello-world-list))
  
  ; Deobfuscate characters by shifting each back by -5 positions
  (define original-list (map (lambda (c) (transform-character c -5)) obfuscated-list))
  
  ; Convert the list of characters back to a string
  (define original-string (list->string original-list))
  
  ; Print the deobfuscated string to the console
  (display original-string)
  (newline))

; Call the function to display "Hello World"

This Racket program uses a custom character transformation to obfuscate and then deobfuscate a "Hello World" string, making it more complex than a simple print statement. It showcases various functional programming techniques available in Racket.
