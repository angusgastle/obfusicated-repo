# Befunge-93 code to display "Hello World" program
# "Befunge" is a stack-based, reflective, esoteric programming language

>>v
 v"dlroW olleH"<
 >,@

# Explanation of each command:
#
# >>v
# '>' moves the instruction pointer (IP) to the right.
# '' is no operation.
# 'v' changes the direction of the IP to move downward.
#
#  v"dlroW olleH"<
# 'v' changes direction of IP to move downwards.
# '"' starts a string mode, which pushes each ASCII value of subsequent characters to the stack.
# Characters "dlroW olleH" are pushed to the stack.
# '"' ends the string mode.
# '<' changes the direction of the IP to move left.
#
#  >,@
# '>' changes the direction of the IP to move right again.
# ',' is the output command and prints the top value from stack as a character.
# '@' is the end of program command.
#
# Here is the translation where IP >, <>
# | v"dlroW olleH"< moves down to load stack:
# H: 72, e: 101, l: 108, l: 108, o: 111, W: 87, o: 111, r: 114, l: 108, d: 100
# ',' outputs values from stack in reverse order since stacks are LIFO by nature.
# '@' ends the program execution.
