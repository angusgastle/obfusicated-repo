This is a "Hello World" program written in Whitespace, a language composed entirely of spaces, tabs, and linefeeds. Each character of the output and the program flow are managed entirely through these invisible characters, making it visually obscure. This specific program, when run through a Whitespace interpreter, will output "Hello, World!". Whitespace commands are executed by reading spaces (' '), tabs ('\t'), and newlines ('\n').
