This program is written in the Whitespace programming language, where only spaces, tabs, and linefeeds have meaning. The program structure carries out simple instructions to push, manipulate, and output the values corresponding to the ASCII codes of the characters "Hello, World!" followed by a newline. Each character's ASCII value is pushed to the stack, then printed in sequence. Due to the nature of Whitespace, the detailed commenting of code as traditionally understood isn't applicable, as any non-whitespace characters are ignored and serve no functional purpose.
