# The following script is written in INTERCAL, an esoteric programming language designed to be as different from conventional programming languages as possible.

## This script demonstrates the "HELLO WORLD" program in INTERCAL.
## It is intentionally verbose and complex to illustrate the capabilities of INTERCAL.
