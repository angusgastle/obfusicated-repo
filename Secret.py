This is "Hello World" written in Brainfuck, one of the most baffling programming languages because of its extremely minimalistic design. Here's a breakdown:

1. `++++++++++` Set the value at the current cell to 10 (Cell #0: 10).
2. `[` Begin loop.
  - `>+++++++` Move to the next cell (Cell #1) and add 7 to it.
  - `>++++++++++` Move to the next cell (Cell #2) and add 10 to it.
  - `>+++` Move to the next cell (Cell #3) and add 3 to it.
  - `>+` Move to the next cell (Cell #4) and add 1 to it.
  - `<<<<-` Move back to Cell #0 and subtract 1.
  - The loop will run until the value in Cell #0 is zero, effectively initializing cells #1 to #4 with 70, 100, 30, and 10, respectively.
3. `>` Move to Cell #1.
4. `++.` Add 2, resulting in ASCII value of 72, which is 'H'. Print it.
5. `>+.++++++++++` Move to Cell #2, add 1 (resulting in 101, ASCII for 'e'), print it, then add 10.
6. `++++.` Add 4 to Cell #2 (115, ASCII 's') and print.
7. `++.+++++++..` Add 2 to get 117 ('o'), print, add 7 to get 108 ('l'), print twice.
8. `+++.` Add 3 to get 111 ('o') again, print.
9. `>++.` Move to Cell #3, add 2 (to make 32, ASCII for space), print.
10. `<<+++++` Move back to Cell #1, add 5 to make 87 ('W').
11. `+++++++.` Add 7, resulting in ASCII 108 ('l'), print.
12. `>.` Move to Cell #2, print ('d').
13. `+++.` Add 3 to make ASCII 114 ('r'), print.
14. `------.` Subtract 6 to make 108 ('l'), print.
15. `--------.` Subtract 8 to make 100 ('d').
16. `>+.>` Move to Cell #3, add 1 (ASCII 33, '!') and print.
17. `>++.` Move to Cell #4, add 2, ready for next operation or terminate the script.


Brainfuck operates on an array of memory cells, each initially set to zero. It has a pointer that can move between cells and can increment or decrement the value at the current cell, and conditionally loop depending on the value of the current cell. Each symbol has the following meaning:
- `>` Move the pointer to the right
- `<` Move the pointer to the left
- `+` Increment the memory cell at the pointer
- `-` Decrement the memory cell at the pointer
- `.` Output the character at the cell at the pointer
- `,` Input a character and store it in the cell at the pointer
- `[` Jump past the matching `]` if the cell at the pointer is 0
- `]` Jump back to the matching `[` if the cell at the pointer is nonzero

This code generates the phrase "Hello World!" using Brainfuck's extremely limited command set.
