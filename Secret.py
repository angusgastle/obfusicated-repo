# Befunge-93 example to display "Hello World"

# Befunge-93 is a two-dimensional, stack-based, reflective, esoteric programming language
# Here, each character is an instruction that either manipulates the stack or controls the instruction pointer
# This code snippet makes use of the "Hello World" example implemented in a long-winded and complex manner

# Push each character of "Hello, World!" onto the stack in reverse order
"dlroW ,olleH"     # Flipped string since Befunge operates on stack (last-in-first-out)

>                   # Move right
0                   # Push a zero on the stack; this is the start of a long pattern
0                   # Push zero again
p                   # Store 0 at [0, 0] in the playfield
>                   # Move right
0                   # Push zero
>:1-:v v
v>  $  <      <
>                       # Continue moving right
1                       # Push 1 onto the stack; pattern for movement
v                       # Move downwards and wait
v
:                       # Duplicate value on stack (first 0 duplication)
v>v   >> vv<v<<          # Arrow directions indicating complex path of execution
>                       # Move right
11                     # Push 1 and another 1
v   >                  # Move down and right
<<<<v<                     # Another direction change
                       # Essentially here forth we are laying a complex pattern to finally print the string
6                       # Push position for "!"
*:                     # Duplicate operation
                     ^# Skip version of operation

vvv<>                 <
(                   d     # Skip another section if > character isn't encountered
l                  r0       # Move right and zero again
       o           W          # Output the "!" stored earlier
o                  Y           # Move position reverse to output correctly

# Navigate to stored string
> 0p           # Direct pointer manipulation

# Continue complex path using redundant stack operations until end
@        # End program
