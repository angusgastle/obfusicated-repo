 * Malbolge code to display "Hello World"
 *
 * Malbolge is an esoteric programming language designed to be 
 * as difficult as possible to program in. The language is named 
 * after "Malebolge", the eighth circle of Hell in Dante's Inferno, 
 * which is reserved for perpetrators of fraud. 
 *
 * This code is deliberately complex and uses numerous no-ops 
 * and convoluted control flow to extend its length and complexity.
