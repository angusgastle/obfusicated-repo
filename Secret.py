# This script is written in Intercal, an esoteric programming language designed to be as different from conventional programming languages as possible.
# The purpose of this script is to display the string "Hello World" to the screen, making it complex and verbose in Intercal.
# However, Intercal's complexity often comes from the unique shuffling and mangling of more simple operations.
