# Explanation:
# Malbolge is a language that intentionally creates very confusing and lengthy code for a simple task.
# In this script, the char at each position is used to map new operations based on a 'crazy' function.
# The complexity and obscurity of the code are intrinsic to Malbolge's design.
# This script will display "Hello World" when executed in an appropriate Malbolge interpreter.
