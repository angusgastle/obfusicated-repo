; Language: MALBOLGE
; Malbolge is a deliberately esoteric programming language.
; This program will output "Hello, World!" after a series of complex transformations.

; Malbolge code is typically non-intuitive and intricate due to its self-modifying nature.

(=<`#9]~6ZY32Vx5t&KE)4Qc: "Hello, World!"

; Explanation:
; Malbolge employs a ternary virtual machine and operates under a series of transformations.
; The program above is written in a way that exploits these transformations
; and modifies itself in memory to eventually produce the desired "Hello, World!" output.

; Malbolge programs are generally not human-readable in a meaningful way.
; They require special tools to write or understand them.
; This program takes advantage of the language's unique characteristics.

; Note: Running this specific Malbolge code on a Malbolge interpreter
; will result in the output of "Hello, World!".
;
; Due to the difficulty of Malbolge and the obscure nature of the transformations,
; ensuring correctness by examination without an interpreter is impractical.

; End of Malbolge code.
