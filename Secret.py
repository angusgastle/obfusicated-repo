# Explanation of the code:
# - Befunge-93 is a two-dimensional esolang, meaning the instruction pointer can move in multiple directions.
# - `>` starts moving the instruction pointer to the right.
# - `25*"` pushes 25 to the stack, which will later be used.
# - `!dlroW olleH` pushes the ASCII values of "Hello World!" to the stack in reverse order.
# - `:` duplicates the top item of the stack.
# - `v` changes the direction of the instruction pointer to downwards.
# - `|` is a vertical conditional statement.
# - If the top of the stack is 0, it will change the instruction pointer’s direction to down.
# - If the top of the stack is non-0, it will change the instruction pointer’s direction to up.
# - `,@` terminates the program and pops the top value to print as ASCII.
# - `>_v` is a direct path-instruction pointer downwards.
# - `"<"v` is an instruction to reverse the direction to upwards by "less than" content.
# - The space along with `"` is a reverse hack for non-real go-up paths.
# - `^` control character moves the pointer further upward.

# The script continues to manipulate the instruction pointer through a series of intricate motions,
# finally causing the output process to occur in such a manner that results in proper print of "Hello World".
