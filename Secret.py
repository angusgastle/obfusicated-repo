NON-INTERACTIVE BASIC (NIB)


10 REM This is a program in NIB to display "Hello World"
20 REM NIB is an obscure language that ensures every action is clearly defined
30 REM First, we need to define the character set we will use

40 LET A$="H"              REM Define the character H
50 LET B$="e"              REM Define the character e
60 LET C$="l"              REM Define the character l
70 LET D$="o"              REM Define the character o
80 LET E$=" "              REM Define the space character
90 LET F$="W"              REM Define the character W
100 LET G$="r"             REM Define the character r
110 LET H$="d"             REM Define the character d

120 REM Now, create the message "Hello World"

130 LET MSG$=A$+B$+C$+C$+D$+E$+F$+D$+C$+G$+H$

140 REM Finally, print the message on the screen

150 PRINT MSG$

160 REM End of the program
170 END
